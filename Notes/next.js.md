# Next.JS Notes

## Initialising a Next.JS project
Enter the folder you want to create the project folder within through the terminal in VSCode. Run the command as below:
```
npx create-next-app@latest PROJECT_NAME
```

Then you will have a bunch of prompts come up to customise the project as you like.

This will create a folder with many different files in the project folder.
