# CSS

Steps to becoming a CSS God:
1. Time & Practice - just continuous practice over an extended period of time.
2. Think of every website you ever make as tetris - just nested rows and columns. 
3. Responsive Web Design (IMPORTANT) - adjust the design and dimensions of your website with varying screen sizes. Always design for mobile first.
4. Memorise your break points (widths/dimensions) at which styling changes to mantain responsivity. Use (640px, 768px, 1024px).
5. Use jankcss.com to play around with different styles and see how it looks (quick feedback on design).
6. Try to replicate beautiful websites (or atleast one key element of it). This way you can develop a library of many different types of web pages, effects, designs to be used in the future. Try to find beautiful websites with cool effects and just try to make it yourself.

## HOW IT WORKS

CSS stands for cascaded style sheets
