# TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is essentially a CSS framework/library that enables the user to design beautiful websites with so many wonderful effects with speed, you no longer need to manually enter every single element of CSS by yourself. You will use TailwindCSS with almost every single website design you ever do.

## How to Install
TailwindCSS first requires node.js to be installed so that you can use the npm function in Terminal to actually install TailwindCSS. So below is a step by step process of how to do it. I won't include exact links because they constantly get updated with new versions

1. Install Node.js from www.nodejs.org (install with chocolatey so node packages are easier to manage in the future).
2. Search up "vite install tailwindcss" on google.
3. Create a tailwindcss starter folder somewhere on your computer and open that in terminal.
4. Run the code they list in their instructions into your terminal (using something like npm create vite@my-project). Make sure not to include any of the react stuff after.
5. Select Vanilla as your framework option to start off (but there are other frameworks you can launch with such as svelte, react, etc).
6. Select Javascript as your variant.
7. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
8. You can delete the .js files and ignore the public item.
9. Clear the CSS file entirely and remove the script in the HTML doc that links to the main.js one.
10. Copy the install TailwindCSS command from the website and copy it directly into your VSC terminal.
