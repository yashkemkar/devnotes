# React.JS Notes

## What is React.JS?
In the early years of the internet, we had vanilla web development - HTML, CSS and JS. This was very cumbersome, too many lines of code and individual code files. Too much repetitive code as well. To solve this, we created JavaScript Frameworks such as React.js, Angular.js, Node.js, Express.js, etc. The important point about JavaScript frameworks is that all the code is primarily written in JavaScript, and uses JavaScript to create HTML & CSS components. We want our websites to be interactive and dynamic, so its easier to make them interactive and then populate with content, than to make content and then try to make it interactive.

Note: JavaScript needs to be run. With react.js we send the react code to the page, and the browser runs a whole lot of JavaScript to produce the HTML and CSS. Now, JavaScript can be run clientside (on the user's computer) or it can be run serverside (on the server) and then send the content to the user's computer.

## Why do we use React.JS
- Compartmentalisation - breaking down larger projects into manageable chunks. The project directory in react.js makes it so easy to maintain a massive project and even work together with multiple team members on large projects.
