# Git Notes
## Introduction
### .gitignore
We can use a .gitignore file in our project to include any files that we don't want to be uploaded to github. The way this is done is by stating the file extensions within the code.

For example, we could exclude .env files which store special API keys with are used to authenticate you with the API. These keys must be protected.
