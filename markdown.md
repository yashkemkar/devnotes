# Markdown

## HOW IT WORKS


### How to set different header sizes:
"#" Assigns as header1 (you have to leave a space)
"##" Assigns as header2 (you have to leave a space)
"###" Assigns as header3 (you have to leave a space)

They progressively get smaller.

### How to change text to be italicised, bold, strikethrough, highlighted etc.
To *italicise* something you must use a * on each side of the string/word. 
```
*italicise*
```

To make something **bold** you must use two ** on each side of the string/word.
```
**bold**
```

### How to make checklists
Checklists are pretty simple, all you have to do is use dashes for each line as so:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And to put a check box you just use the ([]) square brackets inside the round brackets (either with an empty space or with an x in them)
```
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No
```
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

### How to do a bullet-point list:
Simply just use one star at the start of each line and enter to do another.
Example: I like...
* Cars
* Motorcycles
* Planes

### How to enter code (without markdown syntax interpreting it):
We use the backwards apostrophe ` 3 times to start a comment and again to end a comment
```
{enter any code in here}
```
You can copy the code directly out of here.

## How to create tables:
Tables are a little simple. You do the first set of columns/rows with |, then the second is just dashed lines, then continue on with as many items as you want.
The syntax in markdown is as shown here and the result is below:
```
|Column 1|Column 2|
|--------|--------|
|Item 1|Price 1|
|Item 2|Price 2|
```
|Column 1|Column 2|
|--------|--------|
|Item 1|Price 1|
|Item 2|Price 2|

### How to introduce links:
The format for links is pretty simple - as shown below. And the link below is an example of that markdown syntax.
```
[hypertext](link address)
```

### How to introduce block quotes:
These indented quotes are quite simple to add in if you feel like you need to remember something someone said, or a principle to follow or something. It uses the greater than sign ōn its own line similar to the list, as shown below.
```
>"quote" - person
```
